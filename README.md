# Loan Defaulters Predictions:
 **Please read the Project Proposal PDF**
 
## How to view the repository:
1. First go to the Data Visualization folder. Some preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis has been done there to make sense out of the data. The semi-cleaned up file has been saved as 'new_loan.csv' and is used in the Data Wrangling notebook. 'new_loan.csv'- https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cpy80IIoSXsxbMMVHfLgkclpx6woroo1. 
2. Then go to the Data Wrangling Folder. Most of the data cleaning has been done there such as eliminating the null values, filling up the null values, etc., each column is analyzed out of the whole 52 columns, so please be patient. Then this data is saved as 'Cleaned_loan.csv' and is used for the Machine Learning folder. 'Cleaned_data.csv' - https://drive.google.com/open?id=11vy3jSMmRJPcPFP4-q_nvkfuZqkIhaUv.
3. In the Machine Learning folder, we do all the modeling part, fitting the training dataset to different models and testing them out. In the end, different metrics of testing has been used.
